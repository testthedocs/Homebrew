Don't use unexpandad acronyms e.g. cascading style sheets (CSS), Massachusis Institute of Technology (MIT), or Frequently asked questions (FAQ). Or css, MIT, or FAQ.

We should Spell out numbers less than nine. And use "american puctuation."

You rarely need a semi-colon do you?

And don't use lots and lots of words.
